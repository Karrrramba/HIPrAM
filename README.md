Hydrophobic Interaction chromatography Protein porfiling with Bayesian Additive Models 

The HIPrBAM project aims at identifying differences in protein elution profiles from 2D LC-MS/MS experiments.
This is achieved by fitting two BAMs for each protein in the data set and quantyfying differences between the models by the likelihood ratio test (LRT).
